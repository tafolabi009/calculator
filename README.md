# Graphing Calculator

This repository contains a graphing calculator project written in Python. The purpose of this project is to provide a robust calculator application that can convert any mathematical formula into graphical representations. Additionally, it includes features such as teacher comments on student graphs, viewing already made graphs, and using an SQLite database for data handling.

## Features

- **World-Class UI Design**: Modern gradient buttons, enhanced color scheme, and smooth visual effects
- **Advanced Graphing System**:
  - Convert mathematical formulas into high-quality graphs
  - Fire mode with animated gradient effects and dynamic coloring
  - Millisecond-precision time plotting for data analysis
  - Support for complex functions, equations, and multiple expressions
  - Real-time intersection detection and solution highlighting
  - Advanced interpolation methods (linear, cubic, quadratic)
- **3D Plot Mode**: Future-ready 3D plotting capability (coming soon)
- **Interactive Features**:
  - View and interact with previously created graphs
  - Real-time graph updates
  - Zoom and pan controls
  - Save graphs as images (PNG, JPEG)
- **Collaborative Tools**:
  - Teachers can add comments on student graphs
  - Students can view teacher comments on their dashboard
- **Data Management**: Store and manage data using SQLite database with full history tracking

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- SQLite (built-in with Python)
- PyQt6>=6.8.0
- numpy>=1.24.0
- matplotlib>=3.7.0
- scipy>=1.10.0

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tafolabi009/calculator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd calculator
    ```
3. Install required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application script:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
2. **Login/Register**: Create an account or login as a student or teacher.

3. **Plotting Graphs**:
   - Enter a mathematical expression (e.g., `sin(x)`, `x^2 + 2*x + 1`)
   - Optionally enter a second expression to plot multiple functions
   - Adjust range (Min/Max) and scale type (Linear, Log, Polar, Parametric)
   - Click "Plot Graph" to visualize your function

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - **üî• Fire Mode**: Enable stunning fire-themed gradient effects on your plots
   - **‚è±Ô∏è Millisecond Time Mode**: Plot with millisecond-precision timestamps for time-series data
   - **üìä 3D Plot Mode**: Coming soon - three-dimensional visualization

5. **Saving & Sharing**:
   - Click "Save Graph" to store your graph in the database
   - Use "Save Image" to export as PNG or JPEG
   - View your graph history in the sidebar

6. **For Teachers**:
   - Select a student from the dropdown
   - View their submitted graphs
   - Add comments and feedback directly on graphs

## Database
