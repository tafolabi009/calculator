# Returns: [(r,g,b), ...] with smooth red→orange→yellow transition

# Advanced Interpolation
f = calculator.get_advanced_interpolation(x, y, method='cubic')
# Methods: 'linear', 'cubic', 'quadratic'

# Time Series Generation
timestamps = calculator.plot_time_series(start_ms, end_ms, n_points)
# High-resolution time data generation
```

```

### 3. ⏱️ Millisecond Plotting System

#### Implementation Details
```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, ..., millisecond_mode: bool = False,
                 timestamp: Optional[float] = None):
        self.millisecond_mode = millisecond_mode
        self.timestamp = timestamp or time.time()
```

#### Features
```
✓ Millisecond-precision timestamps
✓ High-resolution time-series support
✓ Time-based axis labeling
✓ Data point recording with timestamps
✓ Real-time plotting capability
✓ Graph persistence with timing data
```

#### Usage
```
1. Check "⏱️ Millisecond Time Mode"
2. Plot expression
3. X-axis shows millisecond timestamps
4. Perfect for time-domain analysis
```

### 4. 🔥 Fire Features

#### Fire Mode Implementation

**Canvas Effects:**
```python
def enable_fire_mode(self, enabled=True):
    if enabled:
        # Dark red background
        self.axes.set_facecolor('#1a0000')
        # Orange borders
        self.axes.spines[...].set_color('#ff4500')
        # Fire-colored grid
        self.axes.grid(True, color='#ff6347', ...)
        # Orange tick labels
        self.axes.tick_params(colors='#ffa500')
```

**Gradient Plotting:**
```python
def create_fire_gradient_colors(self, n_points):
    # Generates smooth fire gradient
    # Dark red (0.5,0,0) → Red (1,0,0) → 
    # Orange (1,0.65,0) → Yellow (1,1,0)
    return colors
```

**UI Integration:**
```
✓ Fire mode button (gradient red→orange→yellow)
✓ Fire mode checkbox (synchronized)
✓ Canvas theme toggle
✓ Plot color adaptation
✓ Status bar notifications
✓ Title and legend styling
```

#### Visual Effects
```
Normal Mode:
- Blue color scheme (#3498db)
- Professional dark theme
- Subtle grid lines
- White/light text

Fire Mode:
- Fire color scheme (red/orange/yellow)
- Dark red background
- Orange borders
- Dynamic gradient plotting
- Fire emojis in title
```
